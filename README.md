**Gazebo package for simulation of robots in GÃ¶reme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia)

![cappadocia](img/cappadocia.png)

**Why:** 

1. Much more interesting than mars surface for robotic experiments
2. Challenging surface, with differences in elevation
3. A very cool, historic place

Below is example rocky terrain. Differences in elevation make it very challenging but possible for a UGV or quadruped to operate.

It has historical artifacts such as rock churches, underground houses, with interconnected tunnels. Unfortunately, the 3D mesh do not contain those details.
